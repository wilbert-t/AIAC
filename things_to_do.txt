1. ensamble methods change cannot into csv file into it Category 6: Hybrid & Advanced Ensembles (Mixed Framework)
6.1 Stacking Ensemble
Why use:
•	Model complementarity: Combines different algorithmic strengths
•	Meta-learning: Learns optimal combination of base model predictions
•	Reduced overfitting: Meta-learner prevents over-reliance on single models
•	Performance ceiling: Often achieves best possible performance
•	Error analysis: Identifies where different models excel
Au cluster specific: XGBoost (patterns) + SVR (smoothness) + Ridge (stability)
6.2 Blending Ensemble
Why use:
•	Simplicity: Weighted average of model predictions
•	Fast training: No complex meta-learning required
•	Stable performance: Less prone to overfitting than stacking
•	Interpretable weights: Shows relative model importance
•	Easy deployment: Simple weighted combination in production
Au cluster specific: Combines best-performing models with optimal weights
6.3 AutoML (TPOT/Auto-sklearn)
Why use:
•	Automated optimization: Explores model and hyperparameter space automatically
•	Time efficiency: Finds good models without manual tuning
•	Novel combinations: Discovers unexpected model pipelines
•	Baseline establishment: Provides strong baseline for custom approaches
•	Feature engineering: Automatic feature transformation discovery
Au cluster specific: Discovers optimal preprocessing + model combinations for SOAP features
6.4 Multi-objective Optimization
Why use:
•	Trade-off exploration: Balances accuracy vs interpretability vs speed
•	Pareto frontier: Identifies models with different trade-offs
•	Deployment flexibility: Choose model based on specific requirements
•	Resource constraints: Considers computational limitations
•	Risk management: Multiple objectives include uncertainty and robustness
